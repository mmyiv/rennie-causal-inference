## Setup

#### Load libraries

```{r}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

#### Read in and clean data

```{r}
# Note that I renamed the data file
minnow <- read_csv(here("data", "minnow.csv")) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  # Rename columns to fish species
  rename(
    northern_redbelly_dace = f182,
    finescale_dace = f183,
    fathead_minnow = f209,
    northern_pearl_dace = f214,
    slimy_sculpin = f382
  ) %>%
   mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%d-%b-%y")) # Change to YMD and date format

# Note: Possibly drop comments column? 
# Seasons also look weird: "aSpring" "zFall" 
# Location refers to net type? "Deep Net"    "Shallow Net" "C. L. Net"   "C.L. Net"    "Shallow"     "Deep"        "Wing net" 
# Flag is all NA
```
